  <h2 class='c004'>ANNOUNCEMENT.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c011'>The Trustees of the John F. Slater Fund propose to publish from time to
time papers that relate to the education of the colored race. These papers
are designed to furnish information to those who are concerned in the administration
of schools, and also to those who by their official stations are
called upon to act or to advise in respect to the care of such institutions.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Trustees believe that the experimental period in the education of
the blacks is drawing to a close. Certain principles that were doubted thirty
years ago now appear to be generally recognized as sound. In the next
thirty years better systems will undoubtedly prevail, and the aid of the
separate States is likely to be more and more freely bestowed. There will
also be abundant room for continued generosity on the part of individuals
and associations. It is to encourage and assist the workers and the thinkers
that these papers will be published.</p>

<p class='c010'>Each paper, excepting the first number (made up chiefly of official documents),
will be the utterance of the writer whose name is attached to it,
the Trustees disclaiming in advance all responsibility for the statement of
facts and opinions.</p>

  <h2 class='c004'>OCCUPATIONS OF THE NEGROES.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c011'>The statistics of occupations used in this paper are from the
Census of 1890, and represent the status of the race on June 1
of that year. The Census takes cognizance only of “gainful”
occupations, excluding from its lists housewives, school children,
men of leisure, etc. Its schedules deal only with wage-earners,
those directly engaged in earning their living.</p>

<h3 class='c012'><span class='sc'>General Statistics.</span></h3>

<p class='c013'>In 1890, out of a total population of 62,622,250, 22,753,884
persons, or 34.6 per cent., were engaged in gainful occupations.
Of the negroes, including all of mixed negro blood, numbering
7,470,040, 3,073,123, or 41.1 per cent., were engaged in gainful
occupations. The proportion was much greater than with
the total population. This total population, however, was
composed of several diverse elements, including, besides the
negroes themselves, the foreign born (of which a large proportion
were adult males), and the native whites. The following
table presents the proportions of each of these elements which
were engaged in gainful occupations:</p>

<table class='table1' summary=''>

    <th class='c006'><i>Proportion.</i></th>
    <th class='c008'><i>Per Cent.</i></th>

    <td class='c014'>55.2</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class='c007'>Negroes</td>
    <td class='c014'>41.1</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_6'>6</span>The diagram No. 1 sets forth these figures in graphic form.
The total area of the square represents the population. This
is sub-divided by horizontal lines into rectangles representing
the various elements of the population, and the shaded part of
each rectangle represents the proportions engaged in gainful
occupations.</p>

<p class='c010'>The proportion was greatest among the foreign born because
of the large proportion of adults, and particularly of males,
among this element. Next to that, the proportion was greatest
among the negroes, being much greater than among the whites
collectively and still greater than among the native whites.</p>

<p class='c010'>Classifying the wage-earners of the country in respect to
race and nativity, it appears that 64.5 per cent. were native
whites, 22 per cent. were of foreign birth, and 13.5 per cent.
were negroes.</p>

<p class='c010'>Analyzing the statistics of occupation by sex, it is discovered
that the proportion of native white males who had occupations
was 53.4 and of females 9.4 per cent. The corresponding
proportion of male negroes was 56.3 per cent. and of female
negroes 26.0 per cent. The male negroes were slightly more
fully occupied than were the native whites, while among females
the proportion of wage-earners was much greater. The difference
between native whites and negroes in the proportion of
wage-earners was, therefore, due mainly to the fuller occupation
of women. To put it in another form: Out of every
hundred native whites who pursued gainful occupations, 85
were males and 15 were females. Of every hundred negroes,
69 were males and 31 were females. Indeed, a larger proportion
of women pursued gainful occupations among negroes
than in any other class of the population.</p>

<h3 class='c012'><span class='sc'>Classification of Occupations.</span></h3>

<p class='c013'>The primary classification of occupations made by the Census
recognized five great groups, as follows: 1. Professions; 2.
Agriculture; 3. Trade and transportation; 4. Manufactures;
5. Personal Service. These titles are self-explanatory, with
the possible exception of the last class, which is mainly composed
of domestic servants.</p>

<p class='c010'>Similar facts are shown by diagram No. 2. In this the total
area of the square represents the number of persons in the
country pursuing gainful occupations. This is divided into
rectangles by horizontal lines, the rectangles being proportioned
respectively to the numbers of the native whites, the foreign
born, and the negroes. The sub-division of these rectangles
by vertical lines indicates the proportion in each group of
wage-earners.</p>

<p class='c010'>The most striking facts brought out by this table and diagram
are that only a trifling proportion of the negroes were
in the professions, that much more than one-half were farmers,
and nearly one-third were engaged in personal (mainly domestic)
service. Indeed, over seven-eighths of them were either
farmers or servants. The proportions engaged in trade and
transportation and in manufactures were very small. In respect
to the farming class, they contrasted sharply with the
foreign born. In trade and transportation and in manufactures
the contrast was even greater, in the contrary direction.
The foreign born contained a much larger proportion of professional
men.</p>

<p class='c010'>Comparing the negroes with the native whites, equally
interesting contrasts appear. Professional men were much
<span class='pageno' id='Page_8'>8</span>more numerous among whites than among negroes. The proportion
of the farming class, although much smaller, was nearer
that of the negroes than was the same class among the foreign
born. In trade and transportation and in manufactures the
native whites had much greater proportions, while in personal
service the proportion was much less than that of the
negroes.</p>

<p class='c013'>It will be interesting to analyze these figures further. The
following table classifies negro wage-earners by occupation and
by sex, giving for each sex the percentage engaged in each
group of occupations:</p>

<p class='c010'>These figures are also illustrated by diagram No. 3, the area
of which represents all negro wage-earners. The two rectangles
into which it is divided represent the males and females;
each of these is sub-divided into rectangles representing the
number in each group of occupations. Of the male negro
wage-earners, more than three-fifths were farmers and a little
less than one-fourth were servants. The two classes jointly
accounted for nearly 85 per cent. of all.</p>

<p class='c010'>Of the females, considerably less than one-half were farmers
and more than one-half were servants—the two classes together
accounting for 95 per cent. of all. This large proportion of
female negro farmers was doubtless made up in the main of
women and female children employed in the cotton fields.</p>

bars the proportion which the negro wage-earners bore in
1890 to the negro population of each state. This proportion

<p class='c013'>The distribution of wage-earners among the five occupation
groups differed widely in different parts of the country. To
study it, it will be sufficient to group the states and analyze
the statistics of each group.</p>

<p class='c010'>The groups which will be used here are those which have
been in use in the last two censuses—namely, the northeastern
and southeastern, north central and south central, and western
groups. The states and territories of which each group is
composed are shown in map No. 5.</p>

<p class='c010'>Examination of the states forming the above groups will
show that the groups are in many respects very characteristic.
The southeastern and south central groups contain nine-tenths
of the negroes of the country. These states may be said to
constitute the home of the negro, while in the northern and
western states he is an immigrant.</p>

<h3 class='c012'><span class='sc'>Occupations by Sex and State Groups.</span></h3>

<p class='c013'>Diagram No. 6 shows the distribution by sex and by groups
of states of the negro wage-earners. It appears that in the
northeastern, southeastern, and south central groups two-thirds
of the wage-earners were males and one-third were females,
while in the north central and western groups about five-sixths
were males and one-sixth only were females. This is in part
due to the disproportionate number of males in these parts of
the country.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>Diagram No. 7 shows the distribution of the negro wage-earners,
classified by sex, among the five occupation groups
and by groups of states. The length of each bar represents
100 per cent., and each bar is divided proportionately among
the different occupation groups. Thus from it we read that
in the northeastern states 15 per cent. of the male wage-earners
were engaged in agriculture, 56 per cent. in personal service,
16 per cent. in trade and transportation, 12 per cent. in manufactures,
and 2 per cent. in the professions.</p>

<p class='c010'>It is seen that a far larger proportion of male wage-earners
were engaged in agriculture in the southern states than in the
northern and western states, the proportion in the two groups
of the former states being 64 and 71 per cent., while in the
northeastern states only 15 per cent. were engaged in agriculture,
in the north central states 26 per cent., and in the western
states 17 per cent.</p>

<p class='c010'>In trade and transportation the highest proportion was found
in the northeastern states, where it was 16 per cent.; in the
north central states it was 14 and in the western states 10 per
cent., while in the southeastern states it was 7 per cent. and
in the south central states 7 per cent.</p>

<p class='c010'>Of course, the magnitude of the proportion in the northeastern
states is due to the fact that this is the commercial and
manufacturing section of the country, where a large proportion
of all the population is engaged in these avocations. The
same is the case, though in less degree, in the north central
states, while the southern states are almost purely agricultural.
The figures relating to manufacturing occupations show similar
characteristics. It will be noted that in the northern and
western states the occupations of the negroes were more diversified
than in the southern states. Agriculture and personal
service in the northeastern states occupied but 71 per cent. of
all wage-earners, in the north central states they occupied 75
per cent., and in the western states 81 per cent., while in the
southeastern states these two occupation groups comprised 84
per cent. and in the south central 88 per cent. of all.</p>

<p>Proportions of Males and Females among the Negro Wage-earners.<br /><br /><span class='right'>Diagram No. 8.</span></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>The diagram shows in a similar manner the distribution of
the female negro wage-earners. There were engaged in agriculture
in the northern and western states but a trifling proportion
of negro women, while in the southern states as a whole
nearly one-half of the female negro wage-earners were engaged
in that avocation. On the other hand, personal service occupied
fully nine-tenths of the female wage-earners in the northern
and western states, while in the southern states less than
one-half were engaged in it. Indeed, 94 per cent. of the
female wage-earners of the west were engaged in personal
service, 91 per cent. in the northeastern states, and 87 per
cent. in the north central states. In trade and transportation
the proportion was trifling, and in manufactures it was
small, although much larger in the north and west than in
the south.</p>

<p class='c010'>Here, also, we see that agriculture and personal service
occupied nearly all wage-earners—91 per cent. in the northeastern
states, 96 per cent. in the southeastern states, 89 per
cent. in the north central states, 97 per cent. in the south
central states, and 95 per cent. in the western states. Occupations
were slightly more diversified in the north and west
than in the southern states, as was the case with the males.</p>

<h3 class='c012'><span class='sc'>Occupations by States.</span></h3>

<p class='c013'>It will now be of interest to extend this study in detail by
states, but, in doing so, the study will be confined to the
southern, the former slave states, which are, in a sense, the
home of the negro, and in which more than nine-tenths
of them live. In most of the northern states the number
of negroes is so small that any conclusions drawn from statistics
regarding them are worthless and are likely to be misleading.</p>

<p class='c010'>Diagram No. 8 shows the distribution by sex of the negro
wage-earners of these southern states. The total length of the
bar represents in each case all the wage-earners, the white portion
representing the males and the shaded portion the females.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>This diagram shows that the greatest proportion of female
wage-earners is in the District of Columbia, where it is nearly
one-half of all negro wage-earners, and the least in West Virginia,
where it is less than one-fifth of all. In most of the
cotton states it ranges from one-fourth to one-third of all
negro wage-earners.</p>

<p class='c010'>Diagrams Nos. 9 and 10 present the proportion of male
and of female negro wage-earners who are engaged in agriculture,
personal service, and other occupations in the southern
states.</p>

<p class='c010'>The first of these diagrams, representing male wage-earners,
shows that agriculture and personal service accounted for from
63 to 94 per cent. of all male wage-earners. Indeed, excluding
the District of Columbia from consideration, from 73 to
93 per cent. were accounted for by these two occupations.</p>

<p class='c010'>Again excluding the District of Columbia, which is not a
farming community, the male wage-earners who were farmers
constituted in the different states proportions varying from 36
per cent. in Missouri to 85 per cent. in Mississippi. The proportion
of farmers was highest in the cotton states and decidedly
less in the border states. On the other hand, the proportion
of males engaged in personal service was least in the cotton
states and increased decidedly in those further north.</p>

<p class='c010'>The second diagram, illustrating the occupations of female
wage-earners, has certain features in common with that relating
to males, but these features are more accented. In the
cotton states a large proportion of the female wage-earners
worked in the fields, and was therefore reported as engaged in
agriculture, while in the border states but a small proportion
was found there. On the other hand, domestic service claimed
nearly all female wage-earners in the border states, but in the
cotton states a relatively small proportion.</p>

<p class='c010'>Both the diagrams, and especially the first, show an important
feature. In the cotton states wage-earners were almost
entirely either farmers or those engaged in personal service,
but in the states farther north these classes were relatively
smaller and occupations were somewhat more varied.</p>

  <h3 class='c012'><span class='sc'>Ownership of Farms and Homes.</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='c013'>The statistics of farm and home ownership and of mortgage
indebtedness of the Eleventh Census throw some light upon
the pecuniary condition of the negro race.</p>

<p class='c010'>The total number of farms and homes in the country in 1890
was 12,690,152, of which the negroes occupied 1,410,769, or
11.1 per cent. The proportion of negroes to the total population
was at that time 12.20 per cent., showing a deficiency
in the proportion occupying homes and farms when compared
with the population.</p>

<p class='c010'>The number of farms in the country was 4,767,179. Of these,
549,642, or 11.5 per cent., were occupied by negroes, being
a proportion greater than that of farms and homes combined.</p>

<p class='c010'>The number of homes, as distinguished from farms, in the
country was 7,922,973, of which 861,137, or 10.9 per cent.,
were occupied by negroes, being a proportion less than that of
farms and homes combined.</p>

<p class='c010'>Of the 549,632 farms in the country occupied by negroes,
120,738, or 22.0 per cent., were owned by their occupants.
The corresponding proportion for whites was 71.7 per cent.
Of course, as regards tenants, the reverse was the case, the
proportions being for whites 28.3 per cent, and for negroes
78.0 per cent. More than three-fourths of the farms occupied
by negroes were rented; in other words, more than three-fourths
of the negro farmers were tenants, while less than one-fourth
of the white farmers were tenants.</p>

<p class='c010'>Of the farms owned by the negroes, 90.4 per cent. were
without incumbrance. Of those owned by whites, 71.3 were
without incumbrance, showing a much larger proportion encumbered
than among those owned by negroes.</p>

<p class='c010'>Of 861,137 homes occupied by negroes in 1890, 143,550
were owned by their occupants and 717,587 were rented, the
proportions being 19.0 per cent. and 81.0 per cent. Corresponding
proportions for whites were 39.4 per cent. and 60.6
per cent. Of the houses owned by negro occupants, 126,264,
or 87.7 per cent., were free and 12.3 encumbered. Corresponding
<span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>figures for whites were 71.3 and 28.7 per cent., showing,
as before, a much greater proportion of free holdings among
negroes than among whites.</p>

<p class='c010'>Diagrams Nos. 11 and 12 summarize the above facts in
graphic form. The total areas of the squares represent the
number of farms and homes respectively, those occupied by
whites and negroes respectively being represented by the rectangles
into which the squares are divided by horizontal lines.
The vertical lines sub-divide these rectangles into others proportional
to the numbers occupied by owners without and with
incumbrance, and by renters.</p>

<p class='c010'>The male negroes occupied in agriculture numbered, in 1890,
1,329,584. Of these, 510,619 occupied farms, the remainder,
818,965, being presumably farm laborers. The negro farmers,
<i>i. e.</i>, occupants of farms, constituted 38.3 per cent. of the male
negroes engaged in agriculture, leaving 61.7 per cent. of the
number as laborers. The corresponding figures for whites were
60.4 per cent. and 39.6 per cent. The proportion of negroes
engaged in agriculture who were farmers—<i>i. e.</i>, occupied
farms—was, therefore, much smaller than that of the whites.
In spite of this low comparative showing, however, it must be
agreed that, considering all the attendant circumstances, the
proportion of negro farm occupants—more than one-third of
all negroes engaged in agriculture—is unexpectedly large.</p>

<p class='c010'>Summing up the salient points in this paper, it is seen that
in the matter of occupations the negro is mainly engaged either
in agriculture or personal service. He has, in a generation,
made little progress in manufactures, transportation, or trade.
In these two groups of occupations, males are in greater proportion
engaged in agriculture and females in domestic service.
They have, however, during this generation, made good progress
toward acquiring property, especially in the form of
homes and farms, and, in just so far as they have acquired
possession of real estate, it is safe to say that they have become
more valuable as citizens. The outlook for them is very
favorable as agriculturists, but there is little prospect that the
race will become an important factor in manufactures, transportation,
or commerce.</p>
